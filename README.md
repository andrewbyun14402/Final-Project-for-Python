# Shlithering Shnakes Python Final Project

Youtube Link: https://youtu.be/Is-zo-LkJL8
Overall our group enjoyed learning to make this game however, we could not achieve our ultimate goal which was adding a CPU shnake to the game so we modified it so that it is a two player game. Our group learned what randrange is after we struggled with alignment with the food and snake with randint. In the video, we were not able to demonstrate the whole thing due to the fact that we did not have two players together to play it. 
I hope you enjoy and have fun with it!
Thank you for this opportunity to be able to collaborate with classmates to make a fun project like this :)
