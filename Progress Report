We were able to make the screen, the shnake, food 1 & 2, keyboard controls, updating the score when the shnake eats a food, and adding square body to the shnake whenever it eats food. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

CPU Shnake

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Loading pygame has been a problem for some of my partners so we are using just turtles instead.
